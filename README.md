### In understanding Modern Cryptographic methods through Chaotic Attractors
This was a brief project done in line with our Non-Linear Dynamics course in application of various chaotic maps and flows in modern cryptographic systems. 
A humble attempt made in recreating the results of "Novel Chaos-Based Cryptography Algorithm and Its Performance Analysis‚Äù published in MDPI"  [https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/14/2434]. The term paper introduces 
the various aspects of analysing chaotic flows and then further moves into explaining the code for recreating the above results.
